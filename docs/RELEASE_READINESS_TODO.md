# Pre-release Documentation and Evidence Checklist

**Current M13/M15 integration checkpoint (2026-11-09):** Independent M15 [run 42547260912](https://github.com/ekamal22/HarborOps-Enterprise-Maritime-Logistics-IT-Operations-Platform/actions/runs/42547260912) passed on `bbf4ba38c9742f4e78b9d184d5b60e8aabf6a04c` (299 unit, 46 contract, 26 selected PostgreSQL, five security/fault, and 21/21 three-engine browser executions). The independently verified M13 report-member RLS optimization and M15 browser fixes were reconciled into successor `verify/g13-g15-m13-m15-successor-20261109` at application checkpoint `825520bde0086336f967e824a7060a0035914f6f`. **Successor combined verification has not executed.** Historical combined [run 42541135825](https://github.com/ekamal22/HarborOps-Enterprise-Maritime-Logistics-IT-Operations-Platform/actions/runs/42541135825) passed only on source `6b05d84bf2f01741b182669c2dd17e39e63d9dda`. G13/G15 acceptance pending; no merge, deployment or service activation. [Current status](STATUS.md).

**Current project state (2026-11-08):** G0-G12 and G16 are accepted and integrated on `main` following [G11/G12 gate closure](M11_M12_G11_G12_GATE_CLOSURE_20261108.md) and PR #33. Earlier source-only and gate-pending notes are superseded; retained dated evidence still describes its original run. M9's ARRI/DEPA hold and 10,000-item cap remain mandatory, M10 projector defaults off, ETA null, M11 evaluator opt-in. There is no authorization for deployment or additional GitHub Actions runs.

**Opened:** 2026-11-06  
**Target:** M24-03 source/evidence reconciliation before M24-04 accessibility and G24 release acceptance.  
**Status:** OPEN. Source-locked combined M13/M15 technical pass is recorded, but final feature synchronization, M13/M15 independent gates, remaining later milestones and release verification are incomplete. No deployment authorization.

## Mandatory tasks before release

- [ ] Reconcile open [PR #21](https://github.com/ekamal22/HarborOps-Enterprise-Maritime-Logistics-IT-Operations-Platform/pull/21) stale-state cleanup, [PR #22](https://github.com/ekamal22/HarborOps-Enterprise-Maritime-Logistics-IT-Operations-Platform/pull/22) M10 planning, [PR #24](https://github.com/ekamal22/HarborOps-Enterprise-Maritime-Logistics-IT-Operations-Platform/pull/24) historical G16 supplement, and any later document branches against accepted `main`. Mark superseded work explicitly rather than silently merging stale content.
- [ ] On the final clean source SHA execute `node scripts/render-execution-graph.mjs --check`, `node scripts/check-planning-docs.mjs` and applicable `node --test scripts/*.test.mjs`. Preserve commands, exact exits and counts. An earlier documentation-only static check does not substitute for final local execution.
- [ ] Check every repository Markdown relative link, current-state statement, milestone dependency, permission matrix, API route, migration count and source/evidence reference against the final accepted code and source-locked evidence. Keep historical failed and superseded records intact.
- [ ] Reconcile [Status](STATUS.md), [Roadmap](ROADMAP.md), [Decisions](DECISIONS.md), [Acceptance Criteria](ACCEPTANCE_CRITERIA.md), [API Contracts](API_CONTRACTS.md), [Security](SECURITY.md), [Operations](OPERATIONS.md), [README](../README.md) and the final release plan with completed milestone closures and the final merge SHA.
- [ ] Verify all pre-release gates and independent reviews, including M10 and future modules, evidence safety, security, dependency/image scans, recovery, performance and M24-04 accessibility. Final G24 acceptance remains separate.
- [ ] Explicitly resolve the accepted G9 transport-backlog operating condition: sustained transport-event processing cannot start until approved verified handling for parked `NeedsReconciliation` work prevents exhausting the 10,000 unresolved-work-item limit.
- [ ] Review G16 continuing limits: statement-time audit cursor caveat, privileged migrator boundary, 365-day online retention with separately verified archival, standalone supplemental source attestation and historic Firefox teardown observation.
- [ ] Record an M24-03 closing memo with final source SHA, evidence paths/hashes, completed gates, known limitations, reviewer disposition and acceptance pending items. Do not close G24 on documentation checks alone.

## Workstation controls

Keep controlled worktrees, caches, databases, Compose/WSL data and verification evidence on E:. Use C: only for unavoidable cleaned temporary activity. Preserve existing retained artifacts and databases. GitHub Actions runs require explicit, separate authorization; documentation-only commits use `[skip ci]` and no attribution trailers.

**Boundary:** This checklist is part of existing M24-03, not a new gate or authorization to host or deploy.
