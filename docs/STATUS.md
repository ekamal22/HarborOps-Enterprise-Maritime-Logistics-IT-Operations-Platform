# Project Status

**As of:** 2026-10-30
**Default branch:** Documentation baseline; no application implementation merged.
**Parallel work:** M0 source implementation exists on the unmerged `feat/m0-engineering-baseline` branch; full runtime verification is outstanding.
**Acceptance:** Pending. No milestone verified or accepted.

## Delivery ledger

The ledger below is the current *observed* state, not a projection from planning nodes. The v1 M0-M6 scheme was superseded for planning by v2 M0-M24. Old v1 milestone IDs beyond M0 must not be read as matching new v2 milestones.

| Milestone | State | Evidence |
| --- | --- | --- |
| **M0 Engineering baseline verification** | In progress on separate feature branch | Existing M0 API, migration, UI, Compose and tests committed; full runtime gate G0 still unverified |
| **M1 Authentication and session lifecycle** | Planned | No verified implementation or accepted gate G1 |
| **M2 Organizations and role isolation** | Planned | No verified implementation or accepted gate G2 |
| **M3 Ports and vessels reference data** | Planned | No verified implementation or accepted gate G3 |
| **M4 Voyages and containers reference data** | Planned | No verified implementation or accepted gate G4 |
| **M5 Shipment lifecycle and concurrency** | Planned | No verified implementation or accepted gate G5 |
| **M6 Container and voyage assignments** | Planned | No verified implementation or accepted gate G6 |
| **M7 Tracking contracts and source authentication** | Planned | No verified implementation or accepted gate G7 |
| **M8 Durable event inbox and immutable history** | Planned | No verified implementation or accepted gate G8 |
| **M9 Idempotent worker and reconciliation** | Planned | No verified implementation or accepted gate G9 |
| **M10 Event timeline and projection rebuild** | Planned | No verified implementation or accepted gate G10 |
| **M11 Delay rules and shipment exceptions** | Planned | No verified implementation or accepted gate G11 |
| **M12 Shipment search and authorized export** | Planned | No verified implementation or accepted gate G12 |
| **M13 Operational KPI definitions and dashboards** | Planned | No verified implementation or accepted gate G13 |
| **M14 Route mapping and geographic context** | Planned | No verified implementation or accepted gate G14 |
| **M15 Scoped in-app notifications** | Planned | No verified implementation or accepted gate G15 |
| **M16 Audit logging and access hardening** | Planned | No verified implementation or accepted gate G16 |
| **M17 Observability and service health** | Planned | No verified implementation or accepted gate G17 |
| **M18 IT incident lifecycle and remediation** | Planned | No verified implementation or accepted gate G18 |
| **M19 Database recovery and migration rehearsal** | Planned | No verified implementation or accepted gate G19 |
| **M20 Security assurance and dependency review** | Planned | No verified implementation or accepted gate G20 |
| **M21 Performance and capacity benchmarks** | Planned | No verified implementation or accepted gate G21 |
| **M22 Deployment portability and cost controls** | Planned | No verified implementation or accepted gate G22 |
| **M23 Interface polish and accessibility** | Planned | No verified implementation or accepted gate G23 |
| **M24 Release scenarios and evidence closure** | Planned | No verified implementation or accepted gate G24 |

## Planning sources of truth

- [PRD](PRD.md): product scope, personas, success criteria and priorities.
- [Roadmap](ROADMAP.md): milestone scopes, delivery order and G0-G24 acceptance gates.
- [Execution Graph](EXECUTION_GRAPH.md): rendered work-package DAG from [execution-graph.json](execution-graph.json).
- [Requirements](REQUIREMENTS.md) and [Acceptance Criteria](ACCEPTANCE_CRITERIA.md): atomic requirement IDs and detailed checks.
- This file: evidence and true implementation state, not milestone commitments.

## Documentation baseline

- [x] Product vision, 25 small-scope milestones and the dependency graph documented.
- [x] Functional and non-functional requirements drafted.
- [x] Architecture, domain model, and API boundary drafted.
- [x] Tracking processing and security policies drafted.
- [x] Milestone acceptance and verification approach drafted.
- [x] Local-first cost constraints and demonstration plan drafted.
- [ ] Implemented module architecture validated by code.
- [ ] API schema generated from working implementation.
- [ ] CI, migrations, unit, integration, browser, and security tests executed.
- [ ] Observability, incident workflow, and backup/restore demonstrated.
- [ ] Local deployment cost and shutdown verified; hosted safeguards checked only if optional hosting is used.
- [ ] Complete release acceptance.

## Verification evidence

Default-branch application verification: none. The separate M0 feature branch records three isolated Node configuration tests passing, while .NET, real PostgreSQL, Compose, and browser checks remain outstanding. See the [branch verification ledger](https://github.com/ekamal22/HarborOps-Enterprise-Maritime-Logistics-IT-Operations-Platform/blob/feat/m0-engineering-baseline/docs/M0_VERIFICATION.md). Planning commits do not demonstrate runtime behavior.

## Open prerequisites

1. Verify the existing feature-branch solution and local runtime skeleton against G0.
2. Resolve D-001 and D-003 before M1 implementation, and D-002 before M2 work.
3. Expand the M0 metadata seed into two-organization reference fixtures in M1.
4. Execute the existing verification suite; preserve evidence and repair failures.
5. Close G0 with observed end-to-end runtime evidence before M1. All later gates G1-G24 remain planned and open.

## Status update rule

Update this page whenever a milestone materially changes state. Record implemented paths, exact executed checks, failures, accepted limitations, and links to verification artifacts. Do not mark a capability verified based only on documentation or source inspection.
