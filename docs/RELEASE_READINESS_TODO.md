# Pre-release Documentation and Evidence Checklist

**Current M11 source audit (2026-11-08):** [Fourth correctness audit](M11_FOURTH_CORRECTNESS_AUDIT_20261108.md) records snapshot-bound exception-list cursors and protected, tenant-scoped continuation of immutable history beyond the initial 500 entries. This candidate remains unverified, G11-S01 blocked on local policy, G11 acceptance pending, and draft PR #31 unmerged. The M9 sustained transport hold remains in force.

**Opened:** 2026-11-06  
**Target:** M24-03 source/evidence reconciliation before M24-04 accessibility and G24 release acceptance.  
**Status:** OPEN. No final release verification or deployment authorization.

## Mandatory tasks before release

- [ ] Reconcile open [PR #21](https://github.com/ekamal22/HarborOps-Enterprise-Maritime-Logistics-IT-Operations-Platform/pull/21) stale-state cleanup, [PR #22](https://github.com/ekamal22/HarborOps-Enterprise-Maritime-Logistics-IT-Operations-Platform/pull/22) M10 planning, [PR #24](https://github.com/ekamal22/HarborOps-Enterprise-Maritime-Logistics-IT-Operations-Platform/pull/24) historical G16 supplement, and any later document branches against accepted `main`. Mark superseded work explicitly rather than silently merging stale content.
- [ ] On the final clean source SHA execute `node scripts/render-execution-graph.mjs --check`, `node scripts/check-planning-docs.mjs` and applicable `node --test scripts/*.test.mjs`. Preserve commands, exact exits and counts. An earlier documentation-only static check does not substitute for final local execution.
- [ ] Check every repository Markdown relative link, current-state statement, milestone dependency, permission matrix, API route, migration count and source/evidence reference against the final accepted code and source-locked evidence. Keep historical failed and superseded records intact.
- [ ] Reconcile [Status](STATUS.md), [Roadmap](ROADMAP.md), [Decisions](DECISIONS.md), [Acceptance Criteria](ACCEPTANCE_CRITERIA.md), [API Contracts](API_CONTRACTS.md), [Security](SECURITY.md), [Operations](OPERATIONS.md), [README](../README.md) and the final release plan with completed milestone closures and the final merge SHA.
- [ ] Verify all pre-release gates and independent reviews, including M10 and future modules, evidence safety, security, dependency/image scans, recovery, performance and M24-04 accessibility. Final G24 acceptance remains separate.
- [ ] Explicitly resolve the accepted G9 transport-backlog operating condition: sustained transport-event processing cannot start until approved verified handling for parked `NeedsReconciliation` work prevents exhausting the 10,000 unresolved-work-item limit.
- [ ] Review G16 continuing limits: statement-time audit cursor caveat, privileged migrator boundary, 365-day online retention with separately verified archival, standalone supplemental source attestation and historic Firefox teardown observation.
- [ ] Record an M24-03 closing memo with final source SHA, evidence paths/hashes, completed gates, known limitations, reviewer disposition and acceptance pending items. Do not close G24 on documentation checks alone.

## Workstation controls

Keep controlled worktrees, caches, databases, Compose/WSL data and verification evidence on E:. Use C: only for unavoidable cleaned temporary activity. Preserve existing retained artifacts and databases. GitHub Actions must remain disabled; commit with `[skip ci]` and no attribution trailers.

**Boundary:** This checklist is part of existing M24-03, not a new gate or authorization to host or deploy.
